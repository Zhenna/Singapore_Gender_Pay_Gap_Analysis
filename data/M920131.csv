"1. Data are from Comprehensive Labour Force Survey. 2. Residents refer to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. 3. Data exclude Full-Time National Servicemen. 4. Before 2009, full-time employment refers to employment where the normal hours of work is 30 hours or more in a week. From 2009 onwards, full-time employment refers to employment where the normal hours of work is 35 hours or more in a week. 5. Data are classified based on Singapore Standard Occupation Classification (SSOC) 2020. Data for past years which were coded based on earlier versions of the SSOC were mapped to SSOC 2020 as far as possible to facilitate data comparability. Data are not available for 2006 as the level of occupational detail collected in 2006 did not support mapping. 6.  Gross Monthly Income From Employment refers to income earned from employment. For employees, it refers to the gross monthly wages or salaries before deduction of employee CPF contribution and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, tips, other allowance and one-twelfth of annual bonuses. For self-employed persons, gross monthly income refers to the average monthly profits from their business, trade or profession (i.e. total receipts less business expenses incurred) before deduction of income tax. 7. As data are captured from a sample survey, year-on-year income changes are prone to fluctuations and hence should always be interpreted with caution. Income growth studied over longer periods (e.g. 5 to 10 years) smooths out these fluctuations and hence provides a more direct indication of income growth. 8. Data for 2005 are not available as the Comprehensive Labour Force Survey was not conducted due to the conduct of the General Household Survey 2005 by the Singapore Department of Statistics. 9. June 2007 data have been adjusted based on latest revised population estimates from DOS to facilitate comparisons with June 2008 onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
